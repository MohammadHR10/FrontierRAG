### FrontierRAG - A RAG Model Utilizing SambaNova's Pretrained Models

FrontierRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application developed to provide precise and personalized product recommendations. Using Frontier's dataset of over 800,000 customer records, this project integrates data retrieval with the generative capabilities of SambaNova's pretrained large language models (LLMs) for enhanced accuracy and contextual relevance.

#### Features:
- **Pretrained Model Integration**: Leverages SambaNova's pretrained LLM to streamline development and enhance model performance.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines data retrieval with LLMs to ensure data-driven, customer-focused recommendations.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Utilizes robust pretrained models to manage large-scale datasets with ease.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Development Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **Model Framework**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with SambaNova's pretrained LLMs

#### How It Works:
1. **Pretrained Model Utilization**: Adopts SambaNova’s pretrained LLM to reduce training complexity and focus on fine-tuning for the dataset.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant customer data points to feed into the pretrained model for enhanced recommendations.
3. **Augmented Generation**: Combines the retrieved data with outputs from SambaNova’s LLM to deliver precise and contextually relevant results.

FrontierRAG demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy achievable by integrating SambaNova’s pretrained models with RAG architecture, offering a seamless solution for large-scale recommendation systems.# FrontierRAG
